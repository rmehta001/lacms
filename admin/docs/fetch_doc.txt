VERSION 1.0

ABSTRACT:
Fetch.php is an mutli-purpose application for retrieving ads based on a query
and displays the proper headers and footers.  

USAGE:
By adding keys to the query string,  you define the filter and sorting which then also 
chooses which headers/footers will be displayed.  You can send any or all of the filter keys as
an array by adding '[]' after the name of the key.  This allows one to query on mulitple values
on the same key using the boolean operator 'OR'.  

example:  ?key[]=value1&key[]=value2  translates to KEY=VALUE1 OR KEY=VALUE2

the filter keys as of this version(which are subject to grow) are as follows:
Key	Field	Description
-------------------------------------
cli	CLI	filters to a certain ad agency by group id,  this also determines that the HEADERS and FOOTERS for the agency will be used.
type	TYPE	filters to a certain type (i.e. rentals, sales, etc)  This also determines that the agencys header and footers for tha type will be used.
loc	LOC	filters to a location ID.
priceStart	PRICE	filters all ads greater or equal to the value.
priceEnd	PRICE	filters all ads lesser or equal to the value.
rooms	ROOMS	Filters to that ROOMS value.
fee	NOFEE	FIlters to that nofee value.

There are 10 sort keys defined.  They are sort1, sort2....sort10.  Asigning values to these determine a sorting option in order of definition.
The values for the sort keys are the field names from the database in all caps.  You can use PHPmyAdmin to see what the fields are called.

example ?sort1=LOCNAME&sort2=PRICE&sort3=DATEIN sorts the record set first by LOCNAME, then by PRICE and then by DATEIN
