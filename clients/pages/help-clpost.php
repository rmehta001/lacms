<P>
<li>This Chrome Extension was created so you can Post to Craigslist any listing in the BostonApartments.com system with custom templates that meet Craigslist's requirements. Agents may have separate templates than the company and that is available under Preferences in the BostonApartments.com Main Menu.<BR>
<P>
<li>Clicking the <img width="15" height="15" border="0" vspace="0" hspace="0" src="../images/icons/cl.gif"> will take the current listing you are on and post it to the appropriate Craigslist submission form.<BR>
<P>
<li>It is important that you are logged into your Craigslist account in another tab or window when using this feature. If not, it will send an email to you to confirm submission to Craigslist.<BR>
<P>
<li>If "Ad Title" in the simple view in edit/compose is filled in, it will be used for the Craigslist instead of the auto generated one from the system.<BR>
<P>
<li>Any agent may click  "Preferences" on the Main Menu and then Click "Craigslist Preferences" to get to a screen where the agent may enter phone and email addresses that correspond to their own Craigslist account.<BR>
<P>
<li>If you are logged in and the matching email is used, the listings will show in that Craigslist account.<BR>
<P>
<li>An Agent may have a custom template specifically for Craigslist.<BR>
<P>
<li>The Admin for the Agency may under "Admin" on the Main Menu may then find an option for "Craigslist Preferences". This is where the company preferences for Craigslist ads are stored. The company may have a custom Craiglist template as well.<BR>
<P>
<li>If the posting Agent has a template it is used. If the Agent does not have a custom template the custom company Craigslist template is used. If that does not exist the type specific template (rentals, sales) is used. If the company only has a default company template, that will be used. If that does not exist than a generic template from BostonApartments.com will be used.<BR>
<P>
<li>Using this function does not guarantee inclusion by Craigslist into the Craigslist site. It only fills out the Craigslist forms so you do not have to do any work to post an ad.<BR>
<P>
<li>Craigslist has been known to remove code and links from some advertising. For example embedded YouTube Videos are stripped from a post.<BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="RED">If you are receiving an error posting to Craigslist and it says you are in violation of terms and states "keywords" in the message, you need to edit your craigslist/company header and remove the keywords meta tag.<BR>
<P>
<li>The ads posted the the BostonApartments.com Plugin post the forms to Craigslist from your IP address.  It is therefor imperative not to over post or have many people post from the same IP address or your account/IP address will be blocked by Craigslist.<BR>
<P>
<li><B>It is important that an email and/or phone (cell, direct line) number be entered under 'Preferences' or 'CL preferences' for the account you are posting from.  Also, for rentals, Dates of Availability and Price must be enetered properly for the listing to post.</B>
