<center><B><font color="red">6/12/10</FONT></B></CENTER>
<B>Cambridge &amp; Somerville have been divided up by neighborhood</B> similar to Boston. I have moved many ads to areas that appeared to fit based on the use of the neighborhood name within the ads. Please review your listings and make any needed adjustments. It would be great if you could adjust the remaining listings accordingly (global changes make this VERY EASY). The goal is to get rid of the Cambridge generic and have only real neighborhood ads in Cambridge &amp; Somerville. These areas were so overloaded and the division of listings to proper neighborhoods was requested by readers and will lead to happier clients. This should also help those working in those areas as each of those neighborhoods are very unique.<BR>

Upgraded to Post to the Dig so Titles are not all in caps if an Alternative Ad Title does not exist for the listing.

Remember most of the sites like craigslist, The Dig, Kijiji and others do not allow external style sheets, and type of script, (javascript, php, etc.) and most of the time do not accept embedded images. You should also remember that writing ads in all caps is considered screaming and is impolite on the web.

<center><B><font color="red">6/18/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added <B>CrimeReports.com</B> to the Helpful Tools in the simple edit view of an ad/listing. This information is for office use only. Never offer a printout of this to a client.

<center><B><font color="red">6/2/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Upgraded the Edit/View listing Alternative HTML Ad copy box so ANY code will store and retrieve properly including RTF "no-see-ums" usually found from copying using a MAC.

<center><B><font color="red">5/28/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
<B>Major upgrade to the Manage Photos</B> section of a listing.  <B>You can click on any image to see it full size.</B>. Click it again to return it to thumbnail size. You can <B>delete multiple pictures at the same time</B>. Streamlined the output on the manage photos page.<BR>

<center><B><font color="red">4/4/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>

<center><B><font color="red">4/3/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>

Clicking this brings you to a new screen for creating, editing, deleting and managing additional addenda and forms for landlords that have more than one addendum. You may store as many addenda and forms as you need for any landlord with this new feature. <I>(and yes "addenda" is the correct plural of addendum ;-)</I>

<center><B><font color="red">4/2/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Upgraded the Post to CL, Dig &amp; Kijiji so that the Agent Ad and Alternative HTML ad automatically carry the Price, Fee, Availability Date &amp; Listing ID# after the body of the ad.

<center><B><font color="red">4/1/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added a <B>Post to Kijiji</B> option throughout the site like the Dig and CL. .. New server is being tested as well for the upcoming upgrade!

<center><B><font color="red">3/30/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added an <B>Alternative Agent Ad Body</B>. Every agent in an office may have their own HTML rich ad copy for every listing. If the agent is posting to craigslist, etc. and has an "Alternative Agent Ad Body" it will post as the ad copy instead of the Office's Alternative Ad Body, or regular Ad Body depending on what fields are filled in. This also works on the HTML Ad Maker. Any agent specific searches that may click for further details features this function as well.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER>example link: <A HREF="https://www.BostonApartments.com/cli.php?uid=<?php echo $uid; ?>" target="_NEW">https://www.BostonApartments.com/cli.php?uid=<?php echo $uid; ?></A></CENTER><BR>
<P>
If an agent creates an Alternative Agent Ad Body and uses the above link. The list will show only ads created by that agent. In addition, any ads created by the agent that has details will show the Alternative Agent Ad Body instead of the Offices Ad Body.

<center><B><font color="red">3/29/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Upgraded all public list display of ads to have a link when there's no photo to still click for more details if there is an Alternative Ad Body, Map selected, You Tube Embedded URL. Also upgraded the outputs to note whether the "more details" has more than 1 picture and now says "more photos &amp; details" when more than 1 photo exists for a listing.<BR>
<P>
Upgraded the "Clear Search" under Listings. If you are in a full or simple search and click "Clear Search" you will remain in the search form you chose. If "Clear Search" is clicked when the search forms are hidden, then they remain hidden until a search form style is selected.

<center><B><font color="red">3/28/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added an <B>Alternative Ad Body</B> to the Ad view of a listing. This feature allows full HTML <!-- (including a What You See Is What You Get {WYSIWYG} Editor for those who do not know HTML.) --> If the Alternative Ad Body is filled, it will replace the regular line ad copy in those places where full HTML ads are allowed. (E.g. Googlebase.com does not allow HTML, but clicking for more details at BostonApartments.com does, as well as posting to Craigslist and the Dig, the HTML Ad Maker, etc.)


<center><B><font color="red">3/27/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Upgraded the "<B>Multi-Agency/Multi-Office</B>" database outputs. This feature allows one database to be shared across different offices. Listings are assigned to offices in order to display the office templates, contact information, etc. Whatever Office/Sub Agency the agent is assigned to will dictate which office contact info will appear in the ad if an agent creates or modifies the listing. Changing the status of an ad (Avail, Advertised, Vacant, etc.) will not affect the office designation. Only editing and saving or creating a new listing will affect the which office the listing is assigned to by any agent that is not the Admin. If the Admin is editing an ad, the office designation will not be changed unless the Admin re-assigns the office under "Change Office" in the Ad view (simple) of the ad/listing or in the "Agency View" under Listings. This way the office admin won't have all updating assigned to one office. Multi-Office options and user designations are only available to those offices signed up as a multi-agency office. These changes and upgrades cannot be seen by single office accounts.

<center><B><font color="red">3/26/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added "<B>Mark as Updated</B>" to the action pick list for the check boxes in both the Listings and Ads views.

<center><B><font color="red">3/25/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added <B>"Email Office"</B> to the top menu and "<B>Email All Agents</B>" to the Admin Menu. This feature allows a 1 click email message to everyone in the office that has a log-in and has entered their email address their preferences profile.

<center><B><font color="red">3/24/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added "STUDIO + ALCOVE" to the bedroom size lists. Upgraded the email icon.

<center><B><font color="red">3/23/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added a "suggested title" to the Hot List items when adding something to the Hot List. You may edit, delete or augment the suggested title or type in a new one of your own title.  This feature saves time by not having to type a hot list name in unless you want a custom name.

<center><B><font color="red">3/17/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Updated the manage pictures and picture order functions so you only have to give an order number to those you want instead of all the pictures in a listing. The manage pictures page now shows the pictures in the order they will display in any advertisement.

<center><B><font color="red">3/15/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
You can now <B>change the color of the database screens to your taste</B>. Click on Preferences and you can select the highlight color for the alternating lines in a list, page background color &amp; search box color, column title line color, the top menu, the top yellow bar and the baby blue background edging. So if you liked the original yellow color scheme, you can change it back to yellow. If you want a custom color added, let me know. After you make changes YOU NEED TO LOG OUT AND RE-LOGIN TO SEE THE COLOR CHANGES.

<center><B><font color="red">3/13/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Changed the Street number field in the search to be a LIKE instead of equals. Example This allows you to put in 14 in Street # and Comm in Street and your search results will yield the 1400 Block of Commonwealth listings. 914 Comm will show as well.

<center><B><font color="red">3/12/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Upgraded the Buildings Page to show individual buildings listings for viewing or editing as well as a link for global listings editing by building. Also added the buildings icon to the top of the Edit/View Listing Page in the landlord section next to "View all this Landlord's Listings" so you have access to the landlord's listings and other buildings from within a listing.

<center><B><font color="red">3/11/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Made a new View in Listings for the "Data View". Added a Buildings Icon to the Manage Landlords View for easier access. Added a link to the landlord's on line listings and web site to the Manage Landlords View and to the Ad/Listings Landlord Summary on the top. It shows when used as some landlords keep listings on line and a quick link to their listings from yours is a useful tool.

<center><B><font color="red">3/09/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added <B>Set All This Landlord's Listings to Updated Today</B> button on the top of the "Edit/View Landlord Details form. After editing a landlord's listings with the current changes, the rest of the unchanged listings need to marked up to date as well so this button allows you to mark them all updated in 1 click.<BR>
<BR>
Also added a <B>list of landlord's unique buildings</B> to the bottom of the same form.  This allows you to see the unique buildings list you have for that landlord. Differences in spellings on street names will appear as different buildings, hence this also gives you the opportunity to see what needs to be cleaned up in your database to streamline your data.<BR>
<BR>
You can click on any building on this list and do <B>Global changes to a building like change the cost per parking in all the building's listings without editing each one</B>. (Only users with a user level of 3 or an admin may make global changes to a building.)

<center><B><font color="red">3/08/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added <B>TODAY'S NEW LISTINGS, TODAY'S MODIFIED LISTINGS, AND TODAY'S OFF-LINE LISTINGS</B> to the bottom of the <B>Hot List</B>. There are links to the <B>last 3 day's</B> and <B>current week's</B> worth of listings additions/changes as well.

<center><B><font color="red">2/28/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
Added a <B>Listings View default preference</B> to the preferences menu. This way you can enter the listings in any view you like without having to change from the default view.

Added an optional <B>Ad Title</B> to edit/compose. If this title is filled in, it will be used for the Craigslist and Backpage.com/The Dig Titles instead of the auto generated one from the system.

<center><B><font color="red">2/19/2009</FONT></B></CENTER>
A <B>Post to The Dig</B> (which is Backpage.com) feature has been added. It has been combined with the Craigslist settings to share templates, etc. Normally we feed to Backpage.com through Oodle but it appears that Backpage.com has cut the feed. So until they start taking the feed again, here's a simple 1 click to post to them as well. If there are any sources you would like to see your ads autopost to that are not already receiving a feed, let me know and I'll add it for you.

Spell checking for your ads is now available.  Below the ad text box is a button to check spelling. Click it and you can check and correct the spelling of your ad.

You may now rotate your photos in the photo upload area.<BR>
<P>
You can now also click on the Available green A and change it to U Unavailable from the listings view without having to edit the ad.
<P>
There are new ways to add searches and listings to your site based on the info you put on BostonApartments.com. Go to <A HREF="https://www.BostonApartments.com/developer/searchonyoursite.htm">https://www.BostonApartments.com/developer/searchonyoursite.htm</A> for more information.

To make searches simpler under listings in the back-end database, the location list will now only include towns and cities in which you have listings. This makes selecting them easier. (The full town list will still show under edit and compose with the towns you use the most on the top.)

Cross Street Maps Available!! When picking a map, you can now choose cross street.  Please remember to include the zip code.
<center><B><font color="red">8/15/2006</FONT></B></CENTER>
When doing a search under listings, partial matches will work for "street name". For example a search for "comm" will yield Comm ave, Commonwealth Avenue, etc.<BR>
<P>
Another update is that companies with multiple offices can now have one central database and assign individual listings to a particular office and have that office's contact info show on the ad instead of just the main contact info. This should help those using the system as a back end database for their office allow anyone in any of their offices update with landlords that cross over geographical areas of those offices. This option is only available to those who have it set up though BostonApartments.com.

We have successfully upgraded our servers! You should notice an improvement in speed and capacity.
<center><B><font color="red">3/3/2006</FONT></B></CENTER>
There are now available new plug-ins for your website to show your listings from our database with thumbnail of the associated photographs. If you want to use our new data display methods, let me know.<BR>
<P>
I have also added a great mortgage calculator to the menu which will open in a new window. It takes into account PMI, property taxes and amortizes the loan in a nice format to print out for your sales customers.
<center><B><font color="red">2/12/2006</FONT></B></CENTER>
<div class="menu">Another small update.  Under listings in the default view, you can now click on the green/red light and activate/deactivate the ad from that view. This function will be available wherever you see the green/red light.
<center><B><font color="red">10/24/2005</FONT></B></CENTER>
Publishing is live on the web. Database requests and website plug-ins are live.<BR>
New Reports Section - The "Reports" section now gives you a great overview of the site statistics as well as your agency statistics. There will be even more additions to this section.<BR>
<P>
The Date, A quick Calendar and a World Clock have been added to the top menu system for added convenience. The Calendar will eventually keep track of individual agents' appointments and will be able to be synced with any palm pilot or MS Outlook.<BR>
<P>
You'll be noticing even more changes over the next several weeks. The first scheduled major improvement is the picture interface. The new interface will allow you to see the photos instead of a list and allows for more flexibility with regards to photos.<BR>
<P>
The servers are also being upgraded after a 1 month testing period. They have been in test mode for 2 weeks and will be swapped in a couple of more weeks after further testing. These servers will allow for additional speed, security and growth.<BR>
<P>
Other planned upgrades include a new and improved client section which will allow better management of your clients including mailing lists, etc.
<center><B><font color="red">Update! July 29 2003</font></B></center>
Some new features have been added.  You can now have automatic mapping for your ads/listings...  By zip, zip and street, actual address, and none.  You may also enter a virtual tour address if there is one.<BR>
<P>
The client and landlord sections have been improved for greater flexibility.<BR>
<P>
The last contact date for a landlord can be automatically updated by the most recent modified date of a listing edit or manually. Your preference may be set in the preferences menu.
<center><B><font color="red">Update! March 4th 2003</font></B><br></center>
<div class="menu">There has been a change made to how an agent may edit or compose an Ad/Listing.  This is to fix many existing issues and to make room for more features coming soon. <br>
The main difference is that one no longer has to click the "Compose Listing" link to compose a listing.  Simply click the Compose link as always,  then select the "full" view once the compose screen has loaded.  The edit function works the same way.  
</DIV>
<br>
<br>
It might be cumbersome for some users to switch from the "full" view from the "simple" view every time the want to input a listing.  This can be alleviated by setting the default view for the edit and compose screens.  If you normally just input simple ads,  leave your preferences the unchanged.  If you normally input full listings, then it is suggested that you set this preference to "full".<br>
To change your preferences, click the "Preferences" link above.<br>

</div>
